# Generative AI Chatbot

This project is a generative AI chatbot built using OpenAI and Python, along with several supporting libraries such as LangChain, PyPDF2, Streamlit, Tiktoker, and more. The chatbot takes any PDF as input, processes it by breaking it into chunks, and generates precise and comprehensive answers to questions based on the content of the PDF. Unlike simple retrieval-based systems, this generative AI produces whole answers, creating new content based on the provided dataset.

## Features

- **PDF Processing:** Reads and processes PDF files, breaking them into manageable chunks.
- **Generative Responses:** Generates detailed and precise answers based on the content of the PDF.
- **Streamlit Integration:** Provides an interactive web interface for user interaction.
- **Multiple Libraries:** Utilizes a combination of powerful libraries for efficient processing and response generation.
